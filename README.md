1.	WHAT? – Description and Critical Incidents

At this module I moved from theoretical threat modelling to practical implementation learning not just technical skills, but the human realities of virtual collaboration.
In Unit 3, our team developed an Attack-Defence Tree analysis, identifying Iot vulnerabilities (Hintaw et al., 2021; Laghari et al., 2024). I organised our team using an agile-inspired methodology. 
In Unit 6, I translated those theoretical findings into a Python simulation addressing my research question: "Is message-level encryption (AES-256-GCM) more energy-efficient than TLS 1.3 for IoT devices while maintaining equivalent security?" This explores Availability (energy) and Confidentiality (security) within the ABCDE framework.
Our team (Miriam, Nankyer, Noura, Ameerah, myself) faced mid-project restructuring losing two members! Despite this, we submitted our group deliverable five days early. For Unit 6, I applied the same agile approach, submitting 15 days early.
Key incidents: ADTool macOS failure, car meetings from time zones, team restructuring, collaborative friction, achieving 13.6% energy savings.

2.	SO WHAT? – Analysis and Feelings

When the Luxembourg ADTool failed on my Mac repeatedly, I felt my stomach drop. each error message a small betrayal. I sat there thinking: "Why is this happening to me?" Shostack (2014) notes cross-platform issues are common in security modelling tools. The buffer time in our agile schedule saved me from panicking and allowed me to find a workaround.
Marlow et al. (2018) discuss structured communication mitigating geographical challenges. I learned that commitment sometimes looks like showing up when no one sees the cost.
When Ameerah and Nankyer were reassigned, I felt genuine panic. Purvanova (2014) writes that reliability and quiet professionalism are often more valuable than loud direction. I realised my panic came from caring deeply. Noura taught me that you can care without clutching.
Miriam's approach was harder. When I consolidated our draft into a clean version and she created an entirely new document instead of editing mine, But I swallowed my frustration and kept working, because the project mattered more than my pride. I learned that leadership isn't always recognised sometimes you lead by simply continuing, by not letting friction stop you. Influence stems from action, not titles.

•	Individual Achievement:

When my Python simulation finally ran and I saw 13.6% energy saving, I smiled, after all the stress this small victory felt mine. I thought: I did this. Me. Despite everything.

•	Comparison: Unit 3 vs. Unit 6 :

 
Aspect	Unit 3 Design document	Unit 6 Final Report
Scope	Theoretical ADTree analysis	Empirical Python simulation
Evidence	Literature-based values	Primary data from 3×30 iterations
Contribution	Team-based	Individual coding
Testing	Manual review	Automated unit tests (6/6)
Methodology	Agile team coordination	Agile individual sprints
Outcome	Mitigation identification	Quantitative proof (13.6% saving)

3.	NOW WHAT? – Learning and Professional Development

Skills Developed:

 
Skill	Evidence
Time management	Group: 5 days early; Individual: 15 days early
Critical thinking	Formulated question; analysed energy-security trade-offs
Communication	Created Project Plan; team coordination
IT and Digital	Python, GitHub, ADTool, virtual environments
Numeracy	Energy calculations: E = (0.05W + P_op × m) × t
Research	Multiple academic sources; literature synthesis
Interpersonal	Navigated restructuring; adapted to difficult dynamics
Problem-solving	macOS compatibility workaround; cryptographic simulation
Ethical Awareness	No hardcoded secrets; synthetic data only

•	Feedback Integration:

I organised the team in Unit 3, but my peers organised my thinking and shaped my Unit 6 success.
Tutor feedback said my work showed "deep and well-structured understanding of MQTT security and attack" simulations (Di Paolo, Bassetti and Spognardi, 2023; Laghari et al., 2024). Reading that, I felt something loosen in my chest. Validation, after all the doubt, felt like sunlight.

•	Learning Outcomes:




Artefact	Learning Outcome
Project Plan (Excel)	Team organisation; virtual collaboration
AD Trees	Identify and analyse OS risks
Python Simulation	Evaluate and adapt platforms
README	Critically analyse solutions

•	Professional Development Plan:

1.	Advanced Python for security simulation; expand automated testing
2.	Earlier escalation of workflow inefficiencies; continue agile frameworks
3.	Lead from any position; document contributions objectively
4.	Pursue publication for 13.6% energy-saving findings

6. Conclusion:

This module broke me open. Through it all, Noura's steady presence, my own stubborn commitment, and finally pride when my code worked.
I learned that leadership isn't about titles. It's about showing up in car parks, in frustration, in quiet perseverance. The agile methodology I introduced wasn't just about deadlines it was about creating space for the unexpected, for the human moments that can't be scheduled.
I'm leaving Secure Systems Architecture not just smarter, but stronger. These lessons in patience, technical grit, and navigating human complexity will stay with me.
